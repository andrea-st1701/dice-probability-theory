# dice-probability-theory
the probability theory is a law that describes the results of an experiment performed a large number of times. 
According to this theorem the more times you repeat the experiment, the more the average of all the results of the trials should corrispond to the expected value. 
In this little code we try to demonstrate this by throwing, a provided number of times, two dices and adding the results. 
Then we drew a graph to represent the occurrence of every possible result dividing it by ten the amount of times needed to adapt it to the cmd window. 
The user will notice how, throwing a always larger number of times the graph will correspond to the probabilities of each result to come out.
We finished the project by adding colors to underline even more the results.

We appreciate any idea to improve the code, take some time to review it!
